    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the year 2011 BF17 (Begleitetes Fahren ab 17) was introduced in whole Germany. Young people participating in this program can get a driving license already at the age of 17, one year before the regular permission age, and can drive as long as they are accompanied by an adult companion.\\\n",
    "The benefit of this program was said to be a reduction of driving accidents because young drivers get more expertise together with a experienced companion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I try to find out if this hope can be confirmed by looking at the number of driving accidents among young drivers in combination with the numbers of BF17 participants in the last years. The question is if a correlation can be found in those two numbers: Has a increasing number of BF17 participants lead to less driving accidents among young people?"

    "For this project two open data sources were chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to be solved is if the BF17 program is really used.\n",
    "This question should be solved by checking the \"Fahrerlaubnisse auf Probe\" (driving permits on probation), the number of new class B (normal car) driving permits at the age of 17. These can only be obtained if BF17 is used, as the normal minimum age for class B without BF17 is 18.  \n",
    "These numbers are offered as Excel files from the Kraftfahrbundesamt (KBA) for the years 2017 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the actual number of accidents is researched. The Statistisches Bundesamt offers the number of traffic accidents of all kinds in their Genesis Destatis data warehouse. This statistic contains all numbers of all age groups and all kinds of accidents so the needed numbers (especially accidents among young drivers but also the number of accidents in general) can be selected. Data is available from the years 2008 to 2023.\n",

    "The suite currently contains 7 tests which consist of System tests for both pipelines running all steps, but also extra tests for the single transformation and cleaning steps.\n",
    "The online system test of the destatis_pipeline.py also runs the genesis_puller.py which is why the Genesis account data has to be entered in the test_pipeline.py (variables GENESIS_USER and GENESIS_PASSWORD) to run this test, else it is skipped. An offline system test also exists which is executed each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the single transformation and cleaning steps mock data is used which can be found under project/test_data. Although both data sources have licenses which allow the redistribution of data, the actual data of these tables is randomized/replaced by arbitrary numbers.\n",

    "A CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions which executes the test suite after each commit to the repository was also set up. This pipeline is only set up with the offline Genesis pipeline, the online test with pulling from the Genesis DWH is skipped. The reason for this are, as already explained:\n",
    "- The long execution time of the pipeline of up to several minutes\n",
    "- And the occasional errors and outages of the Genesis database, which could lead to a failing CI/CD pipeline, although the pipeline is not at fault."
